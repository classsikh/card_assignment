**Running a Vite React Project from a Zip File**
This guide describes how to setup and run a pre-built Vite React project downloaded as a zip file.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Node.js (version 14.18.0 or later) installed on your system. You can verify the installation of NodeJS by running the following in your terminal.
2. A program to unzip files (most operating systems come with a built-in unzip utility).

**Steps:**

1.**Unzip the Downloaded File**:Extract the downloaded file into a suitable location on your computer.

2.**Installing Dependencies**:Open a terminal window now and navigate to the project directory, which has been unzipped.
Execute the following command to install the dependencies of the project:
    
     **npm install**

Depending on the size of the project, it might take a few minutes.

3.**Launch the Development Server**

When this is complete, activate the dev server by typing: 

     **npm run dev**

This will spin up the Vite dev server, generally available at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.
